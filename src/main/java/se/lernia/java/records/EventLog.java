//Todo: Implement an event log
// - A method can be called to store an event that happened, use a Record for representing an event.
// - Each event should store type of event, who/what triggered the even and a timestamp
// - Use the generic ArrayList<Event> for storing the events

//Todo: Implement a method or methods that can find and return all events from a specified time.
// - Specific day or hour
// - Intervall that could be from 8.00 a day to 12.00 for example.
// - What should we return when not finding any events?
// - What should happen if we specify start time that is after endtime?

//Todo: Implement a method that can visually present the events depending on the type of event
// - We want to use switch to check for different event types.
// - What type should event type be?
